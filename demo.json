        "description": "This API is built in adherence to the FHIR transaction model, emphasizing single-resource operations to ensure atomic transactions and data integrity. Each endpoint is tailored to a specific resource type to maintain data consistency:\n- **Practitioner Endpoint**: This endpoint is specifically designed to handle practitioner details. It ensures data integrity by exclusively accepting data related to the 'Practitioner' resource type. Ideal for managing individual medical personnel data, including their specialties, qualifications, and contact information.\n- **Location Endpoint**: Concentrates on medical facility locations, taking in only the 'Location' resource type.\n- **Organization Endpoint**: Caters specifically to medical organization data, processing only the 'Organization' resource type.\n- **PractitionerRole Endpoint**: Manages roles associated with medical practitioners, and accepts only the 'PractitionerRole' resource type.\n- **Practitioner Add Endpoint**: This is a unique endpoint to add a brand new practitioner to a TIN that demands comprehensive provider information, including credentialing details. Unlike other endpoints, it expects a bundle containing multiple resources. Ensure that the data submitted here is a complete package of provider information.\n- **Status Inquiry Endpoint**: Provides status of the ATC submission.\n- **config Endpoint**: Provides lists of static values used in Practitioner, Location, Organization, PractitionerRole and Practitioner Add endpoints.\n> Users should be diligent in ensuring that their requests align with the specific resource type designated for each endpoint. Any mismatches will lead to request rejection.",
